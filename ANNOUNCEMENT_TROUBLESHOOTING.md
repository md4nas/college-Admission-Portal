# Announcement System Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Table Creation
- Added `@PrePersist` method to ensure proper field initialization
- Enhanced constructors to set default values
- Created SQL script to manually create table if needed

### 2. Form Submission Issues

- Added validation for required fields

### 3. Data Display Issues
- Added debugging to track data retrieval
- Enhanced repository queries with logging
- Fixed template data binding

## Steps to Resolve

### Step 1: Check Database
1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database
2. Run the SQL script: `create_announcements_table.sql`
3. Verify table exists: `\dt announcements`

### Step 2: Test Application
1. Start the application
2. Login as a teacher
3. Try creating an announcement
4. Check console logs for debugging output

### Step 3: Verify Data
1. Check database for saved announcements:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM announcements ORDER BY created_date DESC;
   ```
2. Check teacher dashboard for recent announcements
3. Check user notifications page for announcements

### Step 4: Debug Output
Look for these debug messages in console:
- `=== ANNOUNCEMENT CREATION DEBUG ===`
- `=== ANNOUNCEMENT SERVICE DEBUG ===`
- `=== TEACHER DASHBOARD DEBUG ===`
- `=== USER NOTIFICATIONS DEBUG ===`

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Table Not Created
**Solution**: Run the SQL script manually or restart application with `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create`

### Issue 2: Form Not Submitting
**Solution**: Check form action URL and ensure CSRF token is included

### Issue 3: Data Not Displaying
**Solution**: Check repository queries and ensure data exists in database

### Issue 4: User Not Seeing Announcements
**Solution**: Verify target audience is set correctly (STUDENT, ALL, etc.)

```bash
